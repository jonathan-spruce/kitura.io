      <h1>CODABLE ROUTING</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p class="sentence">First we need a Kitura server to add our routes to. Kitura has a command-line interface which provides us with utilities for quickly creating a Kitura server.</p>
    <p class="sentence">Once we've installed the Kitura command-line interface, open a terminal window and run the following:</p>
    <p class="sentence">1. Create a directory:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">mkdir ~/CodableRouting</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">2. Change to the new directory:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">cd ~/CodableRouting</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">Create the Kitura server:</p>
    <pre><code>kitura init</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">kitura init creates, builds and generates a starter Kitura Xcode project and will take a couple of minutes to complete. This includes best-practice implementations of health checking and monitoring as well as configuration files to allow easy deployment to a Docker container, a Kubernetes cluster, or the IBM Cloud.</p>
    <p class="sentence">In a terminal run the following:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">open CodableRouting.xcodeproj</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">Now we're ready to start coding!</p>
    <h2>Creating the models</h2>
    <p class="sentence">Codable routing works directly with Swift value types, therefore we need to contruct a value type to use. A good example of this is a struct that conforms to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable">Codable</a>:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">struct User: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">It's good practice to keep value types (in this case models) and logic separated. Create a new file, to contain the models, called Models.swift as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. In Xcode right click on the Application folder and select New File.</li>
      <li>2. Select Swift File in the UI pop up and click next.</li>
      <li>3. In the Save As field, name the file Models.swift.</li>
      <li>4. Ensure Group is Application and target is Application.</li>
      <li>5. Click Create to create the file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="sentence">For now, let's create a very simple model:</p>
    <p class="sentence">1. Open Models.swift</p>
    <p class="sentence">2. Copy in the following code:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">struct User: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">This provides a simple representation of a user that has two properties, a name and an age. In real applications models tend to be more complex, and typically would be made up of various different models.</p>
    <p class="sentence">Now we have a model we can use, next we can create our Codable routes!</p>
    <h2>Registering a POST route</h2>
    <p class="sentence">POST requests are used to send data to the server, but the server needs a route registered for the request. That is, the server needs to know what to do when a POST request comes in on a given URI.</p>
    <p class="sentence">So how do we do this?</p>
    <p class="sentence">It can actually be done quite simply:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">router.post("/users", handler: someHandler)</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">What we're doing here is invoking the post method on the given Router() instance, providing a URI, /users, and a handler.</p>
    <p class="sentence">As we used kitura init to create the server it will be configured to run on http://localhost.</p>
    <p class="sentence">When we provide a URI it is appended to the server's host address, therefore in our case the POST endpoint would be:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">http://localhost/users</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">This means, if a POST request is made to the server on the specified adderess then do something. That 'something' is where the handler comes in.</p>
    <p class="sentence">The handler, someHandler in our case, is a user defined function that contains some logic to be executed when a request is made on the given endpoint.</p>
    <p class="sentence">The function looks something like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">func someHandler(user: User, completion: (User?, RequestError?) -> Void ) {
  //Perform some logic
  ...
  completion(user, nil)
}</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">It accepts two parameters, the User we want to 'POST' to the server and a completion which is a closure.</p>
    <p class="sentence">The completion parameter is a fuction, that accepts an optional User and an optional RequestError. This allows us to respond with the User if all went well or respond with an error if something went wrong by simply passing nil.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">func someHandler(user: User, completion: (User?, RequestError?) -> Void ) {
    //Perform some error handling
    ...
    completion(nil, error)
}</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">Lets go ahead and actually implement a POST endpoint in our Kitura server.</p>
    <p class="sentence">In our CodableRouting Xcode project, open the Application.swift. This is where we will be doing most of out development.</p>
    <p class="sentence">Inside the postInit() function, underneath the line:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">initializeHealthRoutes(app: self)</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">Add the following:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">router.post("/users", handler: postHandler)</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">This will not compile as we haven't actually implemented the postHandler yet. So lets go ahead and do that.</p>
    <p class="sentence">Underneath the postInit() function add the following:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">func storeHandler(user: User, completion: (User?, RequestError?) -> Void ) {
    completion(user, nil)
}</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">Our changes should look like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">...
func postInit() throws {
    // Endpoints
    initializeHealthRoutes(app: self)
    router.post("/users", handler: postHandler)
}

func postHandler(user: User, completion: (User?, RequestError?) -> Void ) {
    completion(user, nil)
}
...
</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">And that's it. We've implemented our first Codable route!</p>
    <p class="sentence">Start the server by running the Xcode project.</p>
    <p class="sentence">The server is now up and running and waiting for a POST request to come in, so lets send a request.</p>
    <p class="sentence">For this you can use any utility that allows you to send HTTP requests such as Postman.</p>
    <p class="sentence">We're going to use the terminal, using curl which is a simple command line tool.</p>
    <p class="sentence">So with your server still running open a terminal and run the following:</p>
    <pre><code>curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/users \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Hello World!",
    "age": 99
}'</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">Then in the terminal we should see the following:</p>
    <pre><code>{"name":"Hello World!","age":99}%</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">But what just happened?</p>
    <p class="sentence">Using curl we were able to make a POST request using curl -X POST to a specified address:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">http://localhost:8080/users</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">We also had to specify what type of content we are sending, in our case this is application/json and we also need to provide the actual JSON we want to send:</p>
    <pre><code>{
    "name": "Hello World!",
    "age": 99
}</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">Kitura takes this JSON object and checks to see if it can be decoded to the type we're expecting, i.e. a User.</p>
    <p class="sentence">If the JSON can be decoded to a User the server will respond with the User we posted as that's what our postHandler logic specifies.</p>
    <p class="sentence">If it can't the server will log an error, to see this we can modify the JSON in the curl request to no longer match the User properties:</p>
    <pre><code>curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/users \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "random": "Hello World!",
    "age": 99
}'</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">In Xcode you should see that an Error is logged in the output.</p>
    <h2>Registering a GET route</h2>
    <p class="sentence">GET requests are used to retrieve data from a server. However we have a flaw in our server, it has no way of storing data for us to retrieve.</p>
    <p class="sentence">So lets rectify that.</p>
    <p class="sentence">In Application.swift underneath the line:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">let cloudEnv = CloudEnv()</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">Add the following:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">private var userStore: [String: User] = [:]</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">We use a dictionary to handle cases where you may want to work with a single User, for example a GET request for a single user.</p>
    <p class="sentence">We now also need to update our postHandler to add the User we post to the userStore.</p>
    <p class="sentence">We can do this like so:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">func postHandler(user: User, completion: (User?, RequestError?) -> Void ) {
    userStore[user.name] = user
    completion(userStore[user.name], nil)
}</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">All we're doing here is using the user's name as the key, and then the actual User as the value.</p>
    <p class="sentence">So now that we have a way of storing posted users, we can add a way for 'getting' all of them. First we need to register a GET endpoint like we did for POST.</p>
    <p class="sentence">So underneath the line:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">router.post("/users", handler: postHandler)</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">Add the following:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">router.get("/users", handler: getAllHandler)</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">Once again this won't compile as we haven't defined a getAllHandler function yet, so lets do that now.</p>
    <p class="sentence">Underneath the postHandler fuction add the following:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">func getAllHandler(completion: ([User]?, RequestError?) -> Void ) {
    let users: [User] = self.userStore.map({ $0.value })
    completion(users, nil)
}</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">Unlike the postHandler we don't need to pass a User as a parameter here as we're not wanting to send anything to the server. We still have the completion closure though, this time accepting an array of User.</p>
    <p class="sentence">This makes sense as we're 'getting' all users, and this could be one user or it could be many users.</p>
    <p class="sentence">We need to convert our userStore dictionary to an array, a simple way of doing that is using the map function Swift provides.</p>
    <p class="sentence">Once we have the array we can pass it to the completion, and that's it.</p>
    <p class="sentence">We've implemented our second route!</p>
    <p class="sentence">Like before we'll use curl to test that our routes work correctly (or use your preferred tool).</p>
    <p class="sentence">Start the server by running your Xcode project and then open a terminal and run the following:</p>
    <pre><code>curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:8080/users \
  -H 'content-type: application/json'</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">In the terminal, we should see the following:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-swift">[]%</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">It's an empty array because we haven't posted any data to the server. Lets post some data to the server:</p>
    <pre><code>curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/users \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Hello World!",
    "age": 99
}'</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">Now that the server has data, lets try running the GET request again:</p>
    <pre><code>curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:8080/users \
  -H 'content-type: application/json'</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">You should now see:</p>
    <pre><code>[{"name":"Hello World!","age":99}]%</code></pre>
    <p class="sentence">We have now posted data to a server, and then been able to retrieve it without having to write much code!</p>
    <p class="sentence">This guide has shown just how easy it is to implement a Kitura Server with Codable routing!</p>
